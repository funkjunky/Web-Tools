TODO:

Current: bug with checkbox clicking affecting other multiselections.

[BUGS]
-sometimes the checkboxes are linked to inputs they shouldn't be... it is very strange, and inconsistant. Hard to reproduce.

[auto-complete]
-package the jquery plugin on Preney's server.
-fix the caret needing to be after the messageGraphicsSystem

[add to JS in general]
-isset function. Or use jQueries if it exists. and replace all code that does a typeof check.

[fix the console automatically showing up for the dialogsystem]
	-it shouldn't be attached to any DOM in the first place =x.

[clean up for jQuery plugin]
-cleaning up the basics of the entire plugin.
-rewrite the maintenance on the autocomplete... adding and removing things and stuff is messy. Write functions to wrap doing those things, so it's one call.
-add warningCallback, and NotifyCallback as callback options, and if one is missing, just use the value supplied to the not missing ones. error = (warning > notify), warning = (notify > warning), notify = (warning > error).
-add the ability to call UserWarning, Error, etc. using a dom element instead of text. if it is a string, then insert as .text, otherwise use .html or if that doesn't work, use .append, but I want to erase anything inside it before attaching, hence not .append.

[add event listeners to jQuery plugins for certain events.]
-add event listener for autocompletes matchClick, and selected [selectionCallback].

DONE:
[checkboxes]
-create the plugin that if the option is set, creates a button to show a div
 with checkboxes for the assoc array given.
	-create the jquery plugin code base.
	-have the text input show up with a button beside it if the option is set
	-have a div pop up when the button is clicked, with checkboxes.
	-have the checkboxes has the proper "value" attributes.
-Have the checkboxes update the input text.
	-for the onclick of the checkboxes have the text be
	added to the input box.
	-for the onclick of the checkbox for deselection, have the input box be 
	searched for the text from the checkbox, then removed.

-Have the input text update the checkboxes.
	-add an onchange event for the text input
		-explode the string by comma and trim whitespace afterwards from the 
		beginning and end of each peice.
		-clear all checkboxes.
		-check each item against the array
			-if it doesn't match perfectly then
			call the error callback with text stating what number entry failed,
			and the text that failed.
				-also add a listener to the associated form's onsubmit that 
				stops the submission and calls the errorCallback with a message 
				that the particular input is incorrect. Keep track of this 
				listener...
			-if it does match, then check the associated checkbox.
				-also take the whitespace trimmed item and append it back to 
				the input. This way we get a nice clean trimmed input.
				This is necessary for unchecking to work cleanly.
		-if all entries matched, then clear the onsubmit listener if it was 
		set.

[auto-complete]
-create a function that takes an array/associative array, and a string, and
 returns a new array with only the elements the contain the string.
-update the function to have an option "loose" that uses the regex I created
	-[hjk].?[as].?[asd].?[iop].?[bnm] for jason. Make sure it's case insensative.
-create a jquery function extension that takes an array, css, and callback. The callback takes a parameter which would be the value of the item selected. The css is for position and sizing the container. (like autocomplete anywhere with any text.)
	-make the div and have it use the css and show up with the divs from the 
	array. 
	-have the callback be triggered with the div that was clicked's name 
	passed as the parameter.
-Have the auto-complete work for when the input is typed in.
	-First tie it together in the most basic way, not including commas.
		-Turn the autocomplete into a regular JS class.
		-create a new instance of autocomplete in the plugin.
			-during initialization the autocomplete should start off hidden.
		-have the onkey of the plugin update the autocomplete via update method.
			-the onkeydown method should .hide all inner divs,
			-then filter the list using the fnc i made,
			-then it should .show all divs that are left after the filter.
		-have the onblur of the plugin call hide on the autocomplete.container div object.
	-Take the caret position and find the first comma after it, and the first
	comma before it. Trim the whitespace before and after, and use this text.
-update the selection to work properly with the commas.
-first entry shouldn't havea  comma at the beginning
-focus should be given back to the input after clicking the auto-complete.
-Whenever a checkbox is checked or unchecked, update the list for autocomplete. This way the user can't put in duplicate items, and it allows them to search for what they need faster with less items to choose from.
-(nevermind)clicking the selection should call "checkboxChecked"
	-Everything goes through onchange.
-their appears to be a bug... something to do with giraffe.
-remove the true false thing on hover. bottom right.
-make sure you can have an associative array for the choices.
-disable up going to the beginning of the input, and down going to the end. Somehow. Ask on facebook about whether it's ok to overwrite default things in a browser if those features are dumb and no one uses them.
